      <h3 id="performance-fastify">Performance (Fastify)</h3>
<p>Under the hood, Nest makes use of <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, but as mentioned already, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fastify">Fastify</a>. How does it work? In fact, what Nest needs to use your favorite library, is a compatible adapter, that primarily proxies corresponding handlers to appropriate library-specific methods. Additionally, your library has to provide at least similar request-response cycle management as express.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fastify">Fastify</a> fits here very well because it solves design issues in a similar manner as express does. However, fastify is much <strong>faster</strong>, achieving almost two times better benchmarks results. The question, why Nest still uses express as a default HTTP provider then? Because express is widely-used, well-known, and has a huge set of compatible middleware.</p>
<p>But we don&#39;t lock people in a single paradigm. We let them use whatever they need. Fastify is a better choice when you care about really good performance, that&#39;s why we provide a built-in <code>FastifyAdapter</code> that helps to integrate this library with Nest.</p>
<h4 appAnchor id="installation"><span>Installation</span></h4>
<p>Firstly, we need to install required package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ npm i --save @nestjs/platform-fastify</code></pre>
<h4 appAnchor id="adapter"><span>Adapter</span></h4>
<p>Once fastify platform is installed, we can use the <code>FastifyAdapter</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
import &#123; NestFactory &#125; from &#39;@nestjs/core&#39;;
import &#123;
  FastifyAdapter,
  NestFastifyApplication,
&#125; from &#39;@nestjs/platform-fastify&#39;;
import &#123; ApplicationModule &#125; from &#39;./app.module&#39;;

async function bootstrap() &#123;
  const app = await NestFactory.create&lt;NestFastifyApplication&gt;(
    ApplicationModule,
    new FastifyAdapter(),
  );
  await app.listen(3000);
&#125;
bootstrap();</code></pre>
<p>If you&#39;re running your Nest instance inside of a <strong>docker container</strong> you will need to specify the host, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
await app.listen(3000, &#39;0.0.0.0&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s all. Also, you are able to pass options into fastify constructor through <code>FastifyAdapter</code> constructor. Keep in mind that now, Nest uses fastify as an <strong>HTTP provider</strong>, meaning, each recipe that relays on express won&#39;t work anymore. You should rather use fastify equivalent packages.</p>
<p>A working example is available <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/10-fastify">here</a>.</p>
