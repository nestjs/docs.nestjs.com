      <h3 id="asynchronous-providers">Asynchronous providers</h3>
<p>When the application start has to be delayed until some <strong>asynchronous tasks</strong> will be finished, for example, until the connection with the database will be established, you should consider using asynchronous providers. In order to create an <code>async</code> provider, we use the <code>useFactory</code>. The factory has to return a <code>Promise</code> (thus <code>async</code> functions fit as well).</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
&#123;
  provide: &#39;ASYNC_CONNECTION&#39;,
  useFactory: async () =&gt; &#123;
    const connection = await createConnection(options);
    return connection;
  &#125;,
&#125;</code></pre>

<h4 appAnchor id="injection"><span>Injection</span></h4>
<p>The asynchronous providers can be simply injected to other components by their tokens (in the above case, by the <code>ASYNC_CONNECTION</code> token). Each class that depends on the asynchronous provider will be instantiated once the async provider is <strong>already resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>The above example is for demonstration purposes. If you&#39;re looking for more detailed one, <a routerLink="/recipes/sql-typeorm">see here</a>.</p>
