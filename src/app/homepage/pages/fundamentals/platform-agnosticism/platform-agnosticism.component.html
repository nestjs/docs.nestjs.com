      <h3 id="platform-agnosticism">Platform agnosticism</h3>
<p>The whole point of Nest is staying as a platform-agnostic framework. A platform independence makes possible creating <strong>reusable logical parts</strong>, that people can take advantage of across several different types of applications. A framework&#39;s architecture is focused on being applicable to any kind of server-side solution.</p>
<h4 appAnchor id="build-once-use-everywhere"><span>Build once, use everywhere</span></h4>
<p>An <strong>overview</strong> category is mostly referring to HTTP server (REST APIs). However, all those building blocks can be easily used in different transport layers (<code>microservices</code> or <code>websockets</code> packages). Furthermore, Nest comes with a dedicated <a routerLink="/graphql/quick-start">GraphQL</a> module. Last but not least, an <a routerLink="/execution-context">execution context</a> feature helps to create everything that runs on Node.js on top of Nest.</p>
<p>Nest inspires to be a fully-fledged platform, that brings a higher-level of reusability for your applications. Build once, use everywhere!</p>
