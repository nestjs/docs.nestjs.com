### Platform agnosticism

The whole point of Nest is staying as a platform-agnostic framework. A platform independence makes possible creating **reusable logical parts**, that people can take advantage of across several different types of applications. A framework's architecture is focused on being applicable to any kind of server-side solution.

#### Build once, use everywhere

An **overview** category is mostly referring to HTTP server (REST APIs). However, all those building blocks can be easily used in different transport layers (`microservices` or `websockets` packages). Furthermore, Nest comes with a dedicated [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) module. Last but not least, an [application context](/application-context) feature helps to create everything that runs on Node.js on top of Nest.

Nest inspires to be a fully-fledged platform, that brings a higher-level of reusability for your applications. Build once, use everywhere!
