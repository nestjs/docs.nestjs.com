### Migration guide

This article provides a set of guidelines for migrating from Nest version 8 to version 9.
To learn more about the new features we've added in v9, check out this [link](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/pull/9588).

#### Redis strategy (microservices)

[Redis](/microservices/redis) strategy uses the [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) driver instead of `redis` now.

```typescript
// Before
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
  AppModule,
  {
    transport: Transport.REDIS,
    options: {
      url: 'redis://localhost:6379',
    },
  },
);

// Now
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
  AppModule,
  {
    transport: Transport.REDIS,
    options: {
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379,
    },
  },
);
```

Also, make sure to install the `ioredis` package:

```bash
$ npm i ioredis
```

#### gRPC client interceptors

In the previous version, the `interceptors` configuration property was exposed in the wrong location. In v9, make sure to pass `interceptors` as part of the `channelOptions` object, see example [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/9079#issuecomment-1078744758).

#### Testing module

Previously, if you wanted to supply the configuration object to the `TestingModule#createNestApplication` method, and if you were using the default HTTP driver (express), you had to do this as follows:

```typescript
app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication<NestExpressApplication>(undefined, {
  rawBody: true,
});
```

In v9, you can skip the first argument (`undefined`):

```typescript
app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication<NestExpressApplication>({
  rawBody: true,
});
```

#### Kafka message/event handlers

Previously, Kafka message and event handlers were receiving payloads as wrapped Kafka messages with `key`, `value`, `headers`, and a few other properties. In v9, those payloads are automatically unwrapped and your handlers will only receive the `value` attribute's value. To retrieve the original Kafka message, you can use the `KafkaContext` object (read more [here](/microservices/kafka#context)).

```typescript
// Before
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage, @Ctx() context: KafkaContext) {
  console.log(`Dragon ID: ${message.value.dragonId}`);
}

// Now
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage, @Ctx() context: KafkaContext) {
  console.log(`Dragon ID: ${message.dragonId}`);
  // Original message: "context.getMessage()"
}
```

#### Kafka retriable errors

In v9, we introduced the **[Retriable exceptions](/microservices/kafka#retriable-exceptions)** feature. Note: for event handlers (**event-based communication**) all unhandled exceptions become "retriable exceptions" by default, and so they will be auto-delivered.

#### Fastify

Fastify has been upgraded to v4. Also, all of the core Fastify plugins that were prefixed with `fastify-` are now renamed and published under the `@fastify` scope (for example, `fastify-cookie` becomes `@fastify/cookie`, `fastify-helmet` becomes `@fastify/helmet`, etc.). Read more [here](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/3856).

#### `@nestjs/swagger` package

There are a few minor breaking changes in the `@nestjs/swagger` package (`swagger-ui-express` and `fastify-swagger` packages are no longer required). See this [PR](https://github.com/nestjs/swagger/pull/1886) for more details.

#### Deprecations

All deprecated methods & modules have been removed (e.g., the deprecated `listenAsync()` method).

#### Node.js

This release drops support for Node v10. We strongly recommend using the latest LTS version.

#### CLI

Due to stability issues, the command `update` was removed in the v9 of `@nestjs/cli`.  
You can use dedicated tools like [`ncu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates), `npm update`, [`yarn upgrade-interactive`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade-interactive), etc., if you want to upgrade your dependencies.
