### Custom route decorators

Nest is built around a language feature called **decorators**. Decorators are a well-known concept in a lot of commonly used programming languages, but in the JavaScript world, they're still relatively new. In order to better understand how decorators work, we recommend reading [this article](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841). Here's a simple definition:

<blockquote class="external">
  An ES2016 decorator is an expression which returns a function and can take a target, name and property descriptor as arguments.
  You apply it by prefixing the decorator with an <code>@</code> character and placing this at the very top of what
  you are trying to decorate. Decorators can be defined for either a class or a property.
</blockquote>

#### Param decorators

Nest provides a set of useful **param decorators** that you can use together with the HTTP route handlers. Below is a list of the provided decorators and the plain Express (or Fastify) objects they represent

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Request()</code></td>
      <td><code>req</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Response()</code></td>
      <td><code>res</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Next()</code></td>
      <td><code>next</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Session()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.session</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Param(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.params</code> / <code>req.params[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Body(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.body</code> / <code>req.body[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Query(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.query</code> / <code>req.query[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Headers(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.headers</code> / <code>req.headers[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Additionally, you can create your own **custom decorators**. Why is this useful?

In the node.js world, it's common practice to attach properties to the **request** object. Then you manually extract them in each route handler, using code like the following:

```typescript
const user = req.user;
```

In order to make your code more readable and transparent, you can create a `@User()` decorator and reuse it across all of your controllers.

```typescript
@@filename(user.decorator)
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, req) => {
  return req.user;
});
```

Then, you can simply use it wherever it fits your requirements.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User() user: UserEntity) {
  console.log(user);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User())
async findOne(user) {
  console.log(user);
}
```

#### Passing data

When the behavior of your decorator depends on some conditions, you can use the `data` parameter to pass an argument to the decorator's factory function. One use case for this is a custom decorator that extracts properties from the request object by key. Let's assume, for example, that our <a href="techniques/authentication#implementing-passport-strategies">authentication layer</a> validates requests and attaches a user entity to the request object. The user entity for an authenticated request might look like:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "firstName": "Alan",
  "lastName": "Turing",
  "email": "alan@email.com",
  "roles": ["admin"]
}
```

Let's define a decorator that takes a property name as key, and returns the associated value if it exists (or undefined if it doesn't exist, or if the `user` object has not been created).

```typescript
@@filename(user.decorator)
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data: string, req) => {
  return data ? req.user && req.user[data] : req.user;
});
@@switch
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, req) => {
  return data ? req.user && req.user[data] : req.user;
});
```

Here's how you could then access a particular property via the `@User()` decorator in the controller:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User('firstName') firstName: string) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User('firstName'))
async findOne(firstName) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);
}
```

You can use this same decorator with different keys to access different properties.  If the `user` object is deep or complex, this can make for easier and more readable request handler implementations.

#### Working with pipes

Nest treats custom param decorators in the same fashion as the built-in ones (`@Body()`, `@Param()` and `@Query()`). This means that pipes are executed for the custom annotated parameters as well (in our examples, the `user` argument). Moreover, you can apply the pipe directly to the custom decorator:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User(new ValidationPipe()) user: UserEntity) {
  console.log(user);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User(new ValidationPipe()))
async findOne(user) {
  console.log(user);
}
```
