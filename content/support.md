### Support

Nest is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the community. This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working **after hours**, and busy weekends.

#### How can you help?

Nest doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development. I fully rely on the **goodness** ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this framework even more **powerful**, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:

- become a backer or sponsor on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nest)
- use [PayPal](https://paypal.me/kamilmysliwiec) to send a one-time donation
- or reach me directly: [mail@kamilmysliwiec.com](mailto:mail@kamilmysliwiec.com)

If you fell in love with Nest, or you run a business which is using Nest, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is **actively maintained** and improved. Also, your support could help me to work more on content that benefits whole Nest community, writing either educational blog posts or recording videos.
