### Subscriptions

In addition to fetching data using queries and modifying data using mutations, the GraphQL spec supports a third operation type, called `subscription`. GraphQL subscriptions are a way to push data from the server to the clients that choose to listen to real time messages from the server. Subscriptions are similar to queries in that they specify a set of fields to be delivered to the client, but instead of immediately returning a single answer, a channel is opened and a result is sent to the client every time a particular event happens on the server.

A common use case for subscriptions is notifying the client side about particular events, for example the creation of a new object, updated fields and so on (read more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions)).

#### Enable subscriptions with Apollo driver

To enable subscriptions, set the `installSubscriptionHandlers` property to `true`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  installSubscriptionHandlers: true,
}),
```

> warning **Warning** The `installSubscriptionHandlers` configuration option has been removed from the latest version of Apollo server and will be soon deprecated in this package as well. By default, `installSubscriptionHandlers` will fallback to use the `subscriptions-transport-ws` ([read more](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)) but we strongly recommend using the `graphql-ws`([read more](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws)) library instead.

To switch to use the `graphql-ws` package instead, use the following configuration:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  subscriptions: {
    'graphql-ws': true
  },
}),
```

> info **Hint** You can also use both packages (`subscriptions-transport-ws` and `graphql-ws`) at the same time, for example, for backward compatibility.

#### Code first

To create a subscription using the code first approach, we use the `@Subscription()` decorator (exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package) and the `PubSub` class from the `graphql-subscriptions` package, which provides a simple **publish/subscribe API**.

The following subscription handler takes care of **subscribing** to an event by calling `PubSub#asyncIterator`. This method takes a single argument, the `triggerName`, which corresponds to an event topic name.

```typescript
const pubSub = new PubSub();

@Resolver((of) => Author)
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription((returns) => Comment)
  commentAdded() {
    return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package, while the `PubSub` class is exported from the `graphql-subscriptions` package.

> warning **Note** `PubSub` is a class that exposes a simple `publish` and `subscribe API`. Read more about it [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-subscriptions/setup.html). Note that the Apollo docs warn that the default implementation is not suitable for production (read more [here](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#getting-started-with-your-first-subscription)). Production apps should use a `PubSub` implementation backed by an external store (read more [here](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#pubsub-implementations)).

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

Note that subscriptions, by definition, return an object with a single top level property whose key is the name of the subscription. This name is either inherited from the name of the subscription handler method (i.e., `commentAdded` above), or is provided explicitly by passing an option with the key `name` as the second argument to the `@Subscription()` decorator, as shown below.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  name: 'commentAdded',
})
subscribeToCommentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

This construct produces the same SDL as the previous code sample, but allows us to decouple the method name from the subscription.

#### Publishing

Now, to publish the event, we use the `PubSub#publish` method. This is often used within a mutation to trigger a client-side update when a part of the object graph has changed. For example:

```typescript
@@filename(posts/posts.resolver)
@Mutation(returns => Post)
async addComment(
  @Args('postId', { type: () => Int }) postId: number,
  @Args('comment', { type: () => Comment }) comment: CommentInput,
) {
  const newComment = this.commentsService.addComment({ id: postId, comment });
  pubSub.publish('commentAdded', { commentAdded: newComment });
  return newComment;
}
```

The `PubSub#publish` method takes a `triggerName` (again, think of this as an event topic name) as the first parameter, and an event payload as the second parameter. As mentioned, the subscription, by definition, returns a value and that value has a shape. Look again at the generated SDL for our `commentAdded` subscription:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

This tells us that the subscription must return an object with a top-level property name of `commentAdded` that has a value which is a `Comment` object. The important point to note is that the shape of the event payload emitted by the `PubSub#publish` method must correspond to the shape of the value expected to return from the subscription. So, in our example above, the `pubSub.publish('commentAdded', {{ '{' }} commentAdded: newComment {{ '}' }})` statement publishes a `commentAdded` event with the appropriately shaped payload. If these shapes don't match, your subscription will fail during the GraphQL validation phase.

#### Filtering subscriptions

To filter out specific events, set the `filter` property to a filter function. This function acts similar to the function passed to an array `filter`. It takes two arguments: `payload` containing the event payload (as sent by the event publisher), and `variables` taking any arguments passed in during the subscription request. It returns a boolean determining whether this event should be published to client listeners.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded(@Args('title') title: string) {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

#### Mutating subscription payloads

To mutate the published event payload, set the `resolve` property to a function. The function receives the event payload (as sent by the event publisher) and returns the appropriate value.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  resolve: value => value,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

> warning **Note** If you use the `resolve` option, you should return the unwrapped payload (e.g., with our example, return a `newComment` object directly, not a `{{ '{' }} commentAdded: newComment {{ '}' }}` object).

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  resolve(this: AuthorResolver, value) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return value;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The same construction works with filters:

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

#### Schema first

To create an equivalent subscription in Nest, we'll make use of the `@Subscription()` decorator.

```typescript
const pubSub = new PubSub();

@Resolver('Author')
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription()
  commentAdded() {
    return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

To filter out specific events based on context and arguments, set the `filter` property.

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

To mutate the published payload, we can use a `resolve` function.

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  resolve: value => value,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction:

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  resolve(this: AuthorResolver, value) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return value;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The same construction works with filters:

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The last step is to update the type definitions file.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String
  votes: Int
}

type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}

type Comment {
  id: String
  content: String
}

type Subscription {
  commentAdded(title: String!): Comment
}
```

With this, we've created a single `commentAdded(title: String!): Comment` subscription. You can find a full sample implementation [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/master/sample/12-graphql-schema-first).

#### PubSub

We instantiated a local `PubSub` instance above. The preferred approach is to define `PubSub` as a [provider](/fundamentals/custom-providers) and inject it through the constructor (using the `@Inject()` decorator). This allows us to re-use the instance across the whole application. For example, define a provider as follows, then inject `'PUB_SUB'` where needed.

```typescript
{
  provide: 'PUB_SUB',
  useValue: new PubSub(),
}
```

#### Customize subscriptions server

To customize the subscriptions server (e.g., change the path), use the `subscriptions` options property.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  subscriptions: {
    'subscriptions-transport-ws': {
      path: '/graphql'
    },
  }
}),
```

If you're using the `graphql-ws` package for subscriptions, replace the `subscriptions-transport-ws` key with `graphql-ws`, as follows:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  subscriptions: {
    'graphql-ws': {
      path: '/graphql'
    },
  }
}),
```

#### Authentication over WebSockets

Checking whether the user is authenticated can be done inside the `onConnect` callback function that you can specify in the `subscriptions` options.

The `onConnect` will receive as a first argument the `connectionParams` passed to the `SubscriptionClient` (read [more](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#5-authenticate-over-websocket-optional)).

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  subscriptions: {
    'subscriptions-transport-ws': {
      onConnect: (connectionParams) => {
        const authToken = connectionParams.authToken;
        if (!isValid(authToken)) {
          throw new Error('Token is not valid');
        }
        // extract user information from token
        const user = parseToken(authToken);
        // return user info to add them to the context later
        return { user };
      },
    }
  },
  context: ({ connection }) => {
    // connection.context will be equal to what was returned by the "onConnect" callback
  },
}),
```

The `authToken` in this example is only sent once by the client, when the connection is first established.
All subscriptions made with this connection will have the same `authToken`, and thus the same user info.

> warning **Note** There is a bug in `subscriptions-transport-ws` that allows connections to skip the `onConnect` phase (read [more](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/issues/349)). You should not assume that `onConnect` was called when the user starts a subscription, and always check that the `context` is populated.

If you're using the `graphql-ws` package, the signature of the `onConnect` callback will be slightly different:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
  driver: ApolloDriver,
  subscriptions: {
    'graphql-ws': {
      onConnect: (context: Context<any>) => {
        const { connectionParams, extra } = context;
        // user validation will remain the same as in the example above
        // when using with graphql-ws, additional context value should be stored in the extra field
        extra.user = { user: {} };
      },
    },
  },
  context: ({ extra }) => {
    // you can now access your additional context value through the extra field
  },
});
```

#### Enable subscriptions with Mercurius driver

To enable subscriptions, set the `subscription` property to `true`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<MercuriusDriverConfig>({
  driver: MercuriusDriver,
  subscription: true,
}),
```

> info **Hint** You can also pass the options object to set up a custom emitter, validate incoming connections, etc. Read more [here](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/blob/master/docs/api/options.md#plugin-options) (see `subscription`).

#### Code first

To create a subscription using the code first approach, we use the `@Subscription()` decorator (exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package) and the `PubSub` class from the `mercurius` package, which provides a simple **publish/subscribe API**.

The following subscription handler takes care of **subscribing** to an event by calling `PubSub#asyncIterator`. This method takes a single argument, the `triggerName`, which corresponds to an event topic name.

```typescript
@Resolver((of) => Author)
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription((returns) => Comment)
  commentAdded(@Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
    return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators used in the example above are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package, while the `PubSub` class is exported from the `mercurius` package.

> warning **Note** `PubSub` is a class that exposes a simple `publish` and `subscribe` API. Check out [this section](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/blob/master/docs/subscriptions.md#subscriptions-with-custom-pubsub) on how to register a custom `PubSub` class.

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

Note that subscriptions, by definition, return an object with a single top level property whose key is the name of the subscription. This name is either inherited from the name of the subscription handler method (i.e., `commentAdded` above), or is provided explicitly by passing an option with the key `name` as the second argument to the `@Subscription()` decorator, as shown below.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  name: 'commentAdded',
})
subscribeToCommentAdded(@Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
  return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
}
```

This construct produces the same SDL as the previous code sample, but allows us to decouple the method name from the subscription.

#### Publishing

Now, to publish the event, we use the `PubSub#publish` method. This is often used within a mutation to trigger a client-side update when a part of the object graph has changed. For example:

```typescript
@@filename(posts/posts.resolver)
@Mutation(returns => Post)
async addComment(
  @Args('postId', { type: () => Int }) postId: number,
  @Args('comment', { type: () => Comment }) comment: CommentInput,
  @Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub,
) {
  const newComment = this.commentsService.addComment({ id: postId, comment });
  await pubSub.publish({
    topic: 'commentAdded',
    payload: {
      commentAdded: newComment
    }
  });
  return newComment;
}
```

As mentioned, the subscription, by definition, returns a value and that value has a shape. Look again at the generated SDL for our `commentAdded` subscription:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

This tells us that the subscription must return an object with a top-level property name of `commentAdded` that has a value which is a `Comment` object. The important point to note is that the shape of the event payload emitted by the `PubSub#publish` method must correspond to the shape of the value expected to return from the subscription. So, in our example above, the `pubSub.publish({{ '{' }} topic: 'commentAdded', payload: {{ '{' }} commentAdded: newComment {{ '}' }} {{ '}' }})` statement publishes a `commentAdded` event with the appropriately shaped payload. If these shapes don't match, your subscription will fail during the GraphQL validation phase.

#### Filtering subscriptions

To filter out specific events, set the `filter` property to a filter function. This function acts similar to the function passed to an array `filter`. It takes two arguments: `payload` containing the event payload (as sent by the event publisher), and `variables` taking any arguments passed in during the subscription request. It returns a boolean determining whether this event should be published to client listeners.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded(@Args('title') title: string, @Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
  return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
}
```

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded(@Args('title') title: string, @Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
  return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
}
```

#### Schema first

To create an equivalent subscription in Nest, we'll make use of the `@Subscription()` decorator.

```typescript
const pubSub = new PubSub();

@Resolver('Author')
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription()
  commentAdded(@Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
    return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

To filter out specific events based on context and arguments, set the `filter` property.

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded(@Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
  return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
}
```

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction:

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded(@Context('pubsub') pubSub: PubSub) {
  return pubSub.subscribe('commentAdded');
}
```

The last step is to update the type definitions file.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String
  votes: Int
}

type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}

type Comment {
  id: String
  content: String
}

type Subscription {
  commentAdded(title: String!): Comment
}
```

With this, we've created a single `commentAdded(title: String!): Comment` subscription.

#### PubSub

In the examples above, we used the default `PubSub` emitter ([mqemitter](https://github.com/mcollina/mqemitter))
The preferred approach (for production) is to use `mqemitter-redis`. Alternatively, a custom `PubSub` implementation can be provided (read more [here](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/blob/master/docs/subscriptions.md))

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<MercuriusDriverConfig>({
  driver: MercuriusDriver,
  subscription: {
    emitter: require('mqemitter-redis')({
      port: 6579,
      host: '127.0.0.1',
    }),
  },
});
```

#### Authentication over WebSockets

Checking whether the user is authenticated can be done inside the `verifyClient` callback function that you can specify in the `subscription` options.

The `verifyClient` will receive the `info` object as a first argument which you can use to retrive the request's headers.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot<MercuriusDriverConfig>({
  driver: MercuriusDriver,
  subscription: {
    verifyClient: (info, next) => {
      const authorization = info.req.headers?.authorization as string;
      if (!authorization?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
        return next(false);
      }
      next(true);
    },
  }
}),
```
