### Helmet

[Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately. Generally, Helmet is just a collection of smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers (read [more](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet#how-it-works)).

> info **Hint** Note that applying `helmet` as global or registering it must come before other calls to `app.use()` or setup functions that may call `app.use()`. This is due to the way the underlying platform (i.e., Express or Fastify) works, where the order that middleware/routes are defined matters. If you use middleware like `helmet` or `cors` after you define a route, then that middleware will not apply to that route, it will only apply to routes defined after the middleware.

#### Use with Express (default)

Start by installing the required package.

```bash
$ npm i --save helmet
```

Once the installation is complete, apply it as a global middleware.

```typescript
import * as helmet from 'helmet';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(helmet());
```

> info **Hint** If you are getting the `This expression is not callable` error while trying to import `Helmet`, you very likely have the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop` options set to `true` in your project's `tsconfig.json` file. If that's the case, change the import statement to: `import helmet from 'helmet'` instead.

#### Use with Fastify

If you are using the `FastifyAdapter`, install the [fastify-helmet](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) package:

```bash
$ npm i --save fastify-helmet
```

[fastify-helmet](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) should not be used as a middleware, but as a [Fastify plugin](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/), i.e., by using `app.register()`:

```typescript
import { fastifyHelmet } from 'fastify-helmet';
// somewhere in your initialization file
await app.register(fastifyHelmet);
```

> warning **Warning** When using `apollo-server-fastify` and `fastify-helmet`, there may be a problem with [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) on the GraphQL playground, to solve this collision, configure the CSP as shown below:
>
> ```typescript
> await app.register(fastifyHelmet, {
>   contentSecurityPolicy: {
>     directives: {
>       defaultSrc: [`'self'`],
>       styleSrc: [
>         `'self'`,
>         `'unsafe-inline'`,
>         'cdn.jsdelivr.net',
>         'fonts.googleapis.com',
>       ],
>       fontSrc: [`'self'`, 'fonts.gstatic.com'],
>       imgSrc: [`'self'`, 'data:', 'cdn.jsdelivr.net'],
>       scriptSrc: [`'self'`, `https: 'unsafe-inline'`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`],
>     },
>   },
> });
>
> // If you are not going to use CSP at all, you can use this:
> await app.register(fastifyHelmet, {
>   contentSecurityPolicy: false,
> });
> ```
