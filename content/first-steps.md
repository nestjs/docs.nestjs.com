### First steps

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Nest. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Nest applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

#### Language

We're in love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but above all - we love [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). That's why Nest is compatible with both TypeScript and **pure JavaScript**. Nest takes advantage of the latest language features, so to use it with vanilla JavaScript we need a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler.

We'll mostly use TypeScript in the examples we provide, but you can always **switch the code snippets** to vanilla JavaScript syntax (simply click to toggle the language button in the upper right hand corner of each snippet).

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 16) is installed on your operating system.

#### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview). With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

> info **Hint** To create a new project with TypeScript's [stricter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) feature set, pass the `--strict` flag to the `nest new` command.

The `project-name` directory will be created, node modules and a few other boilerplate files will be installed, and a `src/` directory will be created and populated with several core files.

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">src</div>
  <div class="children">
    <div class="item">app.controller.spec.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.controller.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.service.ts</div>
    <div class="item">main.ts</div>
  </div>
</div>

Here's a brief overview of those core files:

|                          |                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.controller.ts`      | A basic controller with a single route.                                                                             |
| `app.controller.spec.ts` | The unit tests for the controller.                                                                                  |
| `app.module.ts`          | The root module of the application.                                                                                 |
| `app.service.ts`         | A basic service with a single method.                                                                               |
| `main.ts`                | The entry file of the application which uses the core function `NestFactory` to create a Nest application instance. |

The `main.ts` includes an async function, which will **bootstrap** our application:

```typescript
@@filename(main)

import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
@@switch
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

To create a Nest application instance, we use the core `NestFactory` class. `NestFactory` exposes a few static methods that allow creating an application instance. The `create()` method returns an application object, which fulfills the `INestApplication` interface. This object provides a set of methods which are described in the coming chapters. In the `main.ts` example above, we simply start up our HTTP listener, which lets the application await inbound HTTP requests.

Note that a project scaffolded with the Nest CLI creates an initial project structure that encourages developers to follow the convention of keeping each module in its own dedicated directory.

> info **Hint** By default, if any error happens while creating the application your app will exit with the code `1`. If you want to make it throw an error instead disable the option `abortOnError` (e.g., `NestFactory.create(AppModule, {{ '{' }} abortOnError: false {{ '}' }})`).

#### Platform

Nest aims to be a platform-agnostic framework. Platform independence makes it possible to create reusable logical parts that developers can take advantage of across several different types of applications. Technically, Nest is able to work with any Node HTTP framework once an adapter is created. There are two HTTP platforms supported out-of-the-box: [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [fastify](https://www.fastify.io). You can choose the one that best suits your needs.

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform-express` | [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a well-known minimalist web framework for node. It's a battle tested, production-ready library with lots of resources implemented by the community. The `@nestjs/platform-express` package is used by default. Many users are well served with Express, and need take no action to enable it. |
| `platform-fastify` | [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) is a high performance and low overhead framework highly focused on providing maximum efficiency and speed. Read how to use it [here](/techniques/performance).                                                                                                                                  |

Whichever platform is used, it exposes its own application interface. These are seen respectively as `NestExpressApplication` and `NestFastifyApplication`.

When you pass a type to the `NestFactory.create()` method, as in the example below, the `app` object will have methods available exclusively for that specific platform. Note, however, you don't **need** to specify a type **unless** you actually want to access the underlying platform API.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule);
```

#### Running the application

Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

> info **Hint** To speed up the development process (x20 times faster builds), you can use the [SWC builder](/recipes/swc) by passing the `-b swc` flag to the `start` script, as follows `npm run start -- -b swc`.

This command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the `src/main.ts` file. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the `Hello World!` message.

To watch for changes in your files, you can run the following command to start the application:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

This command will watch your files, automatically recompiling and reloading the server.

#### Linting and formatting

[CLI](/cli/overview) provides best effort to scaffold a reliable development workflow at scale. Thus, a generated Nest project comes with both a code **linter** and **formatter** preinstalled (respectively [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)).

> info **Hint** Not sure about the role of formatters vs linters? Learn the difference [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html).

To ensure maximum stability and extensibility, we use the base [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) cli packages. This setup allows neat IDE integration with official extensions by design.

For headless environments where an IDE is not relevant (Continuous Integration, Git hooks, etc.) a Nest project comes with ready-to-use `npm` scripts.

```bash
# Lint and autofix with eslint
$ npm run lint

# Format with prettier
$ npm run format
```
