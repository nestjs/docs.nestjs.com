### Interceptors

An interceptor is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator, which implements the `NestInterceptor` interface.

Interceptors have a set of useful capabilities which are inspired by the [Aspect Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) (AOP) technique. They make it possible to:

- bind extra logic before / after method execution
- transform the result returned from a function
- transform the exception thrown from a function
- extend the basic function behavior
- completely override a function depending on specific conditions (e.g., for caching purposes)

#### Basics

Each interceptor implements the `intercept()` method, which takes two arguments. The first one is the `ExecutionContext` instance (exactly the same object as for [guards](/guards)). The `ExecutionContext` inherits from `ArgumentsHost`. We saw `ArgumentsHost` before in the exception filters chapter. There, we saw that it's a wrapper around arguments that have been passed to the original handler, and contains different arguments arrays based on the type of the application. You can refer back to the [exception filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#arguments-host) for more on this topic.

#### Execution context

By extending `ArgumentsHost`, `ExecutionContext` also adds several new helper methods that provide additional details about the current execution process. These details can be helpful in building more generic interceptors that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts. Learn more about `ExecutionContext` [here](/fundamentals/execution-context).

#### Call handler

The second argument is a `CallHandler`. The `CallHandler` interface implements the `handle()` method, which you can use to invoke the route handler method at some point in your interceptor. If you don't call the `handle()` method in your implementation of the `intercept()` method, the route handler method won't be executed at all.

This approach means that the `intercept()` method effectively **wraps** the request/response stream. As a result, you may implement custom logic **both before and after** the execution of the final route handler. It's clear that you can write code in your `intercept()` method that executes **before** calling `handle()`, but how do you affect what happens afterward? Because the `handle()` method returns an `Observable`, we can use powerful [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) operators to further manipulate the response. Using Aspect Oriented Programming terminology, the invocation of the route handler (i.e., calling `handle()`) is called a [Pointcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointcut), indicating that it's the point at which our additional logic is inserted.

Consider, for example, an incoming `POST /cats` request. This request is destined for the `create()` handler defined inside the `CatsController`. If an interceptor which does not call the `handle()` method is called anywhere along the way, the `create()` method won't be executed. Once `handle()` is called (and its `Observable` has been returned), the `create()` handler will be triggered. And once the response stream is received via the `Observable`, additional operations can be performed on the stream, and a final result returned to the caller.

#### Aspect interception

The first use case we'll look at is to use an interceptor to log user interaction (e.g., storing user calls, asynchronously dispatching events or calculating a timestamp). We show a simple `LoggingInterceptor` below:

```typescript
@@filename(logging.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    console.log('Before...');

    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        tap(() => console.log(`After... ${Date.now() - now}ms`)),
      );
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    console.log('Before...');

    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        tap(() => console.log(`After... ${Date.now() - now}ms`)),
      );
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `NestInterceptor<T, R>` is a generic interface in which `T` indicates the type of an `Observable<T>` (supporting the response stream), and `R` is the type of the value wrapped by `Observable<R>`.

> warning **Notice** Interceptors, like controllers, providers, guards, and so on, can **inject dependencies** through their `constructor`.

Since `handle()` returns an RxJS `Observable`, we have a wide choice of operators we can use to manipulate the stream. In the example above, we used the `tap()` operator, which invokes our anonymous logging function upon graceful or exceptional termination of the observable stream, but doesn't otherwise interfere with the response cycle.

#### Binding interceptors

In order to set up the interceptor, we use the `@UseInterceptors()` decorator imported from the `@nestjs/common` package. Like [pipes](/pipes) and [guards](/guards), interceptors can be controller-scoped, method-scoped, or global-scoped.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseInterceptors(LoggingInterceptor)
export class CatsController {}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseInterceptors()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Using the above construction, each route handler defined in `CatsController` will use `LoggingInterceptor`. When someone calls the `GET /cats` endpoint, you'll see the following output in your standard output:

```typescript
Before...
After... 1ms
```

Note that we passed the `LoggingInterceptor` type (instead of an instance), leaving responsibility for instantiation to the framework and enabling dependency injection. As with pipes, guards, and exception filters, we can also pass an in-place instance:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseInterceptors(new LoggingInterceptor())
export class CatsController {}
```

As mentioned, the construction above attaches the interceptor to every handler declared by this controller. If we want to restrict the interceptor's scope to a single method, we simply apply the decorator at the **method level**.

In order to set up a global interceptor, we use the `useGlobalInterceptors()` method of the Nest application instance:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalInterceptors(new LoggingInterceptor());
```

Global interceptors are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of dependency injection, global interceptors registered from outside of any module (with `useGlobalInterceptors()`, as in the example above) cannot inject dependencies since this is done outside the context of any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up an interceptor **directly from any module** using the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_INTERCEPTOR } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
      useClass: LoggingInterceptor,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** When using this approach to perform dependency injection for the interceptor, note that regardless of the
> module where this construction is employed, the interceptor is, in fact, global. Where should this be done? Choose the module
> where the interceptor (`LoggingInterceptor` in the example above) is defined. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom provider registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Response mapping

We already know that `handle()` returns an `Observable`. The stream contains the value **returned** from the route handler, and thus we can easily mutate it using RxJS's `map()` operator.

> warning **Warning** The response mapping feature doesn't work with the library-specific response strategy (using the `@Res()` object directly is forbidden).

Let's create the `TransformInterceptor`, which will modify each response in a trivial way to demonstrate the process. It will use RxJS's `map()` operator to assign the response object to the `data` property of a newly created object, returning the new object to the client.

```typescript
@@filename(transform.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

export interface Response<T> {
  data: T;
}

@Injectable()
export class TransformInterceptor<T> implements NestInterceptor<T, Response<T>> {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<Response<T>> {
    return next.handle().pipe(map(data => ({ data })));
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TransformInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next.handle().pipe(map(data => ({ data })));
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Nest interceptors work with both synchronous and asynchronous `intercept()` methods. You can simply switch the method to `async` if necessary.

With the above construction, when someone calls the `GET /cats` endpoint, the response would look like the following (assuming that route handler returns an empty array `[]`):

```json
{
  "data": []
}
```

Interceptors have great value in creating re-usable solutions to requirements that occur across an entire application.
For example, imagine we need to transform each occurrence of a `null` value to an empty string `''`. We can do it using one line of code and bind the interceptor globally so that it will automatically be used by each registered handler.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ExcludeNullInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(map(value => value === null ? '' : value ));
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ExcludeNullInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(map(value => value === null ? '' : value ));
  }
}
```

#### Exception mapping

Another interesting use-case is to take advantage of RxJS's `catchError()` operator to override thrown exceptions:

```typescript
@@filename(errors.interceptor)
import {
  Injectable,
  NestInterceptor,
  ExecutionContext,
  BadGatewayException,
  CallHandler,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ErrorsInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        catchError(err => throwError(() => new BadGatewayException())),
      );
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, BadGatewayException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ErrorsInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        catchError(err => throwError(() => new BadGatewayException())),
      );
  }
}
```

#### Stream overriding

There are several reasons why we may sometimes want to completely prevent calling the handler and return a different value instead. An obvious example is to implement a cache to improve response time. Let's take a look at a simple **cache interceptor** that returns its response from a cache. In a realistic example, we'd want to consider other factors like TTL, cache invalidation, cache size, etc., but that's beyond the scope of this discussion. Here we'll provide a basic example that demonstrates the main concept.

```typescript
@@filename(cache.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class CacheInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    const isCached = true;
    if (isCached) {
      return of([]);
    }
    return next.handle();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class CacheInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    const isCached = true;
    if (isCached) {
      return of([]);
    }
    return next.handle();
  }
}
```

Our `CacheInterceptor` has a hardcoded `isCached` variable and a hardcoded response `[]` as well. The key point to note is that we return a new stream here, created by the RxJS `of()` operator, therefore the route handler **won't be called** at all. When someone calls an endpoint that makes use of `CacheInterceptor`, the response (a hardcoded, empty array) will be returned immediately. In order to create a generic solution, you can take advantage of `Reflector` and create a custom decorator. The `Reflector` is well described in the [guards](/guards) chapter.

#### More operators

The possibility of manipulating the stream using RxJS operators gives us many capabilities. Let's consider another common use case. Imagine you would like to handle **timeouts** on route requests. When your endpoint doesn't return anything after a period of time, you want to terminate with an error response. The following construction enables this:

```typescript
@@filename(timeout.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler, RequestTimeoutException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError, TimeoutError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TimeoutInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle().pipe(
      timeout(5000),
      catchError(err => {
        if (err instanceof TimeoutError) {
          return throwError(() => new RequestTimeoutException());
        }
        return throwError(() => err);
      }),
    );
  };
};
@@switch
import { Injectable, RequestTimeoutException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError, TimeoutError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TimeoutInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next.handle().pipe(
      timeout(5000),
      catchError(err => {
        if (err instanceof TimeoutError) {
          return throwError(() => new RequestTimeoutException());
        }
        return throwError(() => err);
      }),
    );
  };
};
```

After 5 seconds, request processing will be canceled. You can also add custom logic before throwing `RequestTimeoutException` (e.g. release resources).
