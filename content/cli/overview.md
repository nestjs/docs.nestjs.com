### Overview

In order to help people manage their projects, the [CLI](https://github.com/nestjs/nest-cli) tool has been created. It helps on many grounds at once, from scaffolding the project to building well-structured applications. The Nest CLI is based on the [@angular-devkit](https://github.com/angular/devkit) package. Also, there're special schematics that are dedicated to the Nest development [@nestjs/schematics](https://github.com/nestjs/schematics).

#### Installation

Install CLI using **NPM**:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

#### Contribute
