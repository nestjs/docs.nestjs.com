### Exception filters

The built-in **exceptions layer** is responsible for handling all thrown exceptions across your whole application. When an unhandled exception is caught, the end-user will receive an appropriate user-friendly response.

Each occurred exception is handled by the global exception filter, and when it's **unrecognized** (is neither `HttpException` nor a class that inherits from `HttpException`), a user receives the below JSON response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

#### Base exceptions

There's a built-in `HttpException` class exposed from the `@nestjs/common` package. As you already know, when you throw a `HttpException` object, it'll be caught by the handler and afterwards, transformed to the relevant JSON response.

In the `CatsController`, we have a `findAll()` method (a `GET` route). Let's assume that this route handler would throw an exception for some reason. We're gonna hardcode it:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new HttpException('Forbidden', HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
}
```

> info **Hint** We used the `HttpStatus` here. It is a helper enumerator imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

When the client calls this endpoint, the response would look like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden"
}
```

The `HttpException` constructor takes `string | object` as the first argument. If you pass an `object` instead of a `string`, you'll completely override the response body.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new HttpException({
    status: HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN,
    error: 'This is a custom message',
  }, 403);
}
```

And this is how the response would look like:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "error": "This is a custom message"
}
```

#### Exceptions hierarchy

A good practice is to create your own **exceptions hierarchy**. It means that every HTTP exception should inherit from the base `HttpException` class. As a result, Nest will recognize your exception, and will fully take care of the error responses.

```typescript
@@filename(forbidden.exception)
export class ForbiddenException extends HttpException {
  constructor() {
    super('Forbidden', HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
  }
}
```

Since `ForbiddenException` extends the base `HttpException`, it's going to work well with the core exceptions handler, and therefore we can use it inside the `findAll()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

#### HTTP exceptions

In order to reduce the boilerplate code, Nest provides a set of usable exceptions that inherits from the core `HttpException`. All of them are exposed from the `@nestjs/common` package:

- `BadRequestException`
- `UnauthorizedException`
- `NotFoundException`
- `ForbiddenException`
- `NotAcceptableException`
- `RequestTimeoutException`
- `ConflictException`
- `GoneException`
- `PayloadTooLargeException`
- `UnsupportedMediaTypeException`
- `UnprocessableEntityException`
- `InternalServerErrorException`
- `NotImplementedException`
- `BadGatewayException`
- `ServiceUnavailableException`
- `GatewayTimeoutException`

#### Exception filters

The base exception handler is fine, but sometimes you may want to have a **full control** over the exceptions layer, for example, add some logging or use a different JSON schema based on some chosen factors. We adore generic solutions and making your life easier, that's why the feature called **exception filters** has been created.

We are going to create a filter which is responsible for catching exceptions that are an instance of `HttpException` class and set up a custom response logic for them.

```typescript
@@filename(http-exception.filter)
import { ExceptionFilter, Catch, ArgumentsHost, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: HttpException, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();
    const request = ctx.getRequest<Request>();
    const status = exception.getStatus();

    response
      .status(status)
      .json({
        statusCode: status,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        path: request.url,
      });
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse();
    const request = ctx.getRequest();
    const status = exception.getStatus();

    response
      .status(status)
      .json({
        statusCode: status,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        path: request.url,
      });
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All exception filters should implement the generic `ExceptionFilter<T>` interface. It forces you to provide the `catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost)` method with the valid signature. `T` indicates a type of the exception.

The `@Catch(HttpException)` decorator binds the required metadata to the exception filter, telling Nest that this particular filter is looking for `HttpException` and nothing else. In practice, the `@Catch()` decorator may take an endless number of parameters, and therefore you can set up the filter for several types of exceptions by separating them by a comma.

#### Arguments host

The `exception` property is a currently processed exception, while `host` is a `ArgumentsHost` object. The `ArgumentsHost` is a wrapper around arguments that have been passed to the **original** handler, and it contains different arguments array under the hood based on the type of the application (and platform which is being used).

```typescript
export interface ArgumentsHost {
  getArgs<T extends Array<any> = any[]>(): T;
  getArgByIndex<T = any>(index: number): T;
  switchToRpc(): RpcArgumentsHost;
  switchToHttp(): HttpArgumentsHost;
  switchToWs(): WsArgumentsHost;
}
```

The `ArgumentsHost` supplies us with a set of useful methods that helps to pick correct arguments from the underlying array. In other words, `ArgumentsHost` is nothing else than just an **array of arguments**. For example, when the filter is used within HTTP application context, `ArgumentsHost` will contain `[request, response]` array inside. However, when current context is a web sockets application, this array will be equal to `[client, data]`. This design decision enables you to access any argument that would be eventually passed to the corresponding handler.

#### Binding filters

Let's tie `HttpExceptionFilter` to the `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
@@switch
@Post()
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseFilters()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

We have used the `@UseFilters()` decorator here. Same as `@Catch()`, it takes an endless number of parameters. The instance of `HttpExceptionFilter` has been created immediately in-place. Another available way is to pass the class (not instance), leaving framework the instantiation responsibility and enabling **dependency injection**.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@UseFilters(HttpExceptionFilter)
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
@@switch
@Post()
@UseFilters(HttpExceptionFilter)
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

> info **Hint** Prefer applying classes instead of instances when possible. It reduces **memory usage** since Nest can easily reuse instances of the same class among your entire module.

In the example above, the `HttpExceptionFilter` is applied only to the single `create()` route handler, but it's not the only available way. In fact, the exception filters can be method-scoped, controller-scoped, and also global-scoped.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
export class CatsController {}
```

This construction sets up the `HttpExceptionFilter` for every route handler defined inside the `CatsController`. It's the example of the controller-scoped exception filter. The last available scope is the global-scoped exception filter.

```typescript
@@filename(main)
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  app.useGlobalFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

> warning **Warning** The `useGlobalFilters()` method neither set up filters for gateways nor hybrid application.

The global filters are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of dependency injection, global filters registered from the outside of any module (as in the previous example above) cannot inject dependencies since they don't belong to any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up a filter **directly from any module** using following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_FILTER } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_FILTER,
      useClass: HttpExceptionFilter,
    },
  ],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

> info **Hint** The alternative option is to use an [application context](/application-context) feature. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom providers registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Catch everything

In order to handle every occurred exception (regardless of the exception type), you may leave the parentheses empty, e.g. `@Catch()`.

```typescript
import { ExceptionFilter, Catch, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse();
    const request = ctx.getRequest();
    const status = exception.getStatus();

    response.status(status).json({
      statusCode: status,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      path: request.url,
    });
  }
}
```

In the example above the filter will catch each exception that has been thrown without limiting itself to a set of particular classes.

#### Inheritance

Typically, you'll create fully customized exception filters crafted to fulfill your application requirements. There might be use-cases though when you would like to reuse an already implemented, **core exception filter**, and override the behavior based on certain factors.

In order to delegate exception processing to the base filter, you need to extend `BaseExceptionFilter` and call inherited `catch()` method.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Catch, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/core';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/core';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
```

> warning **Warning** Filters that extend base classes have to be instantiated by the framework itself (don't manually create instances using `new` keyword).

You can use a global filter that extends the base filter by injecting the `HttpServer` reference.

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);

  const { httpAdapter } = app.get(HttpAdapterHost);
  app.useGlobalFilters(new AllExceptionsFilter(httpAdapter));

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

Obviously, you should enhance above implementation with your tailored **business** logic (e.g. add various conditions).
