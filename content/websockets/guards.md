### Guards

There is no fundamental difference between web sockets guards and [regular HTTP application guards](/guards). The only difference is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `WsException`.

> info **Hint** The `WsException` class is exposed from `@nestjs/websockets` package. To handle the `WsException` implement a custom filter on the gateway with a `@UseFilter()` decorator. The filter could map socket/error data and emit it back to the client.


#### Binding guards

The following example uses a method-scoped guard. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use gateway-scoped guards (i.e., prefix the gateway class with a `@UseGuards()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: unknown): WsResponse<unknown> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
@@switch
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```
