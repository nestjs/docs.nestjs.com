### Security

In this chapter you will learn some techniques that will allow you to increase the security of your applications.

#### Helmet

[Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately. Generally, Helmet is just a collection of 12 smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers (read [more](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet#how-it-works)). Firstly, install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save helmet
```

Once the installation is completed, apply it as a global middleware.

```typescript
import * as helmet from 'helmet';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(helmet());
```

#### CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows resources to be requested from another domain. Under the hood, Nest makes use of [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) package, that provides a bunch of options that you may customize based on your requirements. In order to enable CORS, you have to call `enableCors()` method.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
app.enableCors();
await app.listen(3000);
```

Also, you can pass a configuration object as a parameter of this function. The available properties are exhaustively described in the official [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) repository. A different way is to use a Nest options object:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, { cors: true });
await app.listen(3000);
```

Instead of passing a boolean value, you can use a cors configuration object as well (read [more](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options)).

#### CSRF

Cross-site request forgery (known as CSRF or XSRF) is a type of malicious exploit of a website where **unauthorized** commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. To mitigate this kind of attacks you can use the [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) package. Firstly, install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save csurf
```

Once the installation is completed, apply it as a global middleware.

```typescript
import * as csurf from 'csurf';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(csurf());
```

#### Rate limiting

To protect your applications from brute-force attacks, you have to implement some kind of rate-limiting. Luckily, there is a bunch of various middleware available on the NPM already. One of them is [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit).

```bash
$ npm i --save express-rate-limit
```

Once the installation is completed, apply it as a global middleware.

```typescript
import * as rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(
  rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  }),
);
```

> info **Hint** If you work with `FastifyAdapter`, consider using [fastify-rate-limit](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit) instead.
