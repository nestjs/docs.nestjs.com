### HTTP adapter

Occasionally, you may want to access the underlying HTTP server, either within the Nest application context or from the outside.

Basically, every native (platform-specific) HTTP server/library instance is wrapped in an **adapter**. The adapter is registered as a globally available provider that might be plucked from the application context as well as injected into other providers easily.

#### Outside strategy

In order to get the `HttpAdapter` from the outside of the application context, you can call `getHttpAdapter()` method.

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
const httpAdapter = app.getHttpAdapter();
```

#### In-context strategy

In order to get the `HttpAdapterHost` from within the application context, you can inject it in the same way as any other existing provider (let's say, through `constructor`).

```typescript
@@filename()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(private readonly adapterHost: HttpAdapterHost) {}
}
@@switch
@Dependencies(HttpAdapterHost)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(adapterHost) {
    this.adapterHost = adapterHost;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `HttpAdapterHost` is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

#### Adapter host

So far, we have learnt how to get the `HttpAdapterHost`. However, it's still not an actual `HttpAdapter`. In order to get the `HttpAdapter`, simply access the `httpAdapter` property.

```typescript
const adapterHost = app.get(HttpAdapterHost);
const httpAdapter = adapterHost.httpAdapter;
```

The `httpAdapter` is a real instance of the HTTP adapter used by the framework underneath. It can be either `ExpressAdapter` or `FastifyAdapter` (both classes extend `AbstractHttpAdapter`).

Every adapter exposes several useful methods to interact with the HTTP server. Nonetheless, if you want to access the library reference directly, call `getInstance()` method.

```typescript
const instance = httpAdapter.getInstance();
```
