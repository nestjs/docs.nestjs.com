### Common errors

During your development with NestJS, you may encounter various errors as you learn the framework.

#### "Cannot resolve dependency" error

Probably the most common error message is about Nest not being able to resolve dependencies of a provider. The error message usually looks something like this:

```bash
Nest can't resolve dependencies of the <provider> (?). Please make sure that the argument <unknown_token> at index [<index>] is available in the <module> context.

Potential solutions:
- If <unknown_token> is a provider, is it part of the current <module>?
- If <unknown_token> is exported from a separate @Module, is that module imported within <module>?
  @Module({
    imports: [ /* the Module containing <unknown_token> */ ]
  })
```


The most common culprit of the error, is not having the `provider` in the module's `providers` array. Please make sure that the provider is indeed in the `providers` array and following [standard NestJS provider practices](/fundamentals/custom-providers#di-fundamentals).

There are a few gotchas, that are common. One is putting a provider in an `imports` array. If this is the case, the error will have the provider's name where `<module>` should be.

If you run across this error while developing, take a look at the module mentioned in the error message and look at its `providers`. For each provider in the `providers` array, make sure the module has access to all of the dependencies. Often times, `providers` are duplicated in a "Feature Module" and a "Root Module" which means Nest will try to instantiate the provider twice. More than likely, the module containing the `provider` being duplicated should be added in the "Root Module"'s `imports` array instead.

#### "Circular dependency" error

Occasionally you'll find it difficult to avoid [circular dependencies](/fundamentals/circular-dependency) in your application. You'll need to take some steps to help Nest resolve these. Errors that arise from circular dependencies look like this:

```bash
Nest cannot create the <module> instance.
The module at index [<index>] of the <module> "imports" array is undefined.

Potential causes:
- A circular dependency between modules. Use forwardRef() to avoid it. Read more: https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/circular-dependency
- The module at index [<index>] is of type "undefined". Check your import statements and the type of the module.

Scope [<module_import_chain>]
# example chain AppModule -> FooModule
```

Circular dependencies can arise from both providers depending on each other, or typescript files depending on each other for constants, such as exporting constants from a module file and importing them in a service file. In the latter case, it is advised to create a separate file for your constants. In the former case, please follow the guide on circular dependencies and make sure that both the modules **and** the providers are marked with `forwardRef`.

#### "Sequqlize & Sequlelize-typescript compatibilty issue" error

If you are using Sequqlize-typescript and installed version of sequelize is 6.6.5 then you might see an error while defining your model.
You will see error similar to this one:
```
node_modules/sequelize-typescript/dist/model/model/model.d.ts:10:31 - error TS2417: Class static side 'typeof import("D:/project-folder/node_modules/sequelize-typescript/dist/model/model/model").Model' incorrectly extends base class static side 'typeof import("D:/project-folder/node_modules/sequelize/types/lib/model").Model'.
  The types returned by 'init(...)' are incompatible between these types.
    Type 'Model<any, any>' is not assignable to type 'MS'.
      'MS' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'Model<any, any>'.
```
This error is because of compatibility issue between sequelize & sequelize-typescript. You will have to wait until either of the package mainters fix this issue.
Meanwhile, to solve this, install sequelize version 6.6.2.
```
npm i sequelize@6.6.2
```
