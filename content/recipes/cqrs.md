### CQRS

The flow of simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update and Delete) applications can be described using the following steps:

1. The **controllers** layer handles HTTP requests and delegates tasks to the services layer.
2. The **services layer** is where most of the business logic lives.
3. Services use **repositories / DAOs** to change / persist entities.
4. Entities act as containers for the values, with setters and getters.

In most cases, for small and medium-sized applications, this pattern is sufficient. However, when our requirements become more complex, the **CQRS** model may be more appropriate and scalable. To facilitate that model, Nest provides a lightweight [CQRS module](https://github.com/nestjs/cqrs). This chapter describes how to use it.

#### Installation

First install the required package:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/cqrs
```

#### Commands

In this model, each action is called a **Command**. When a command is dispatched, the application reacts to it. Commands can be dispatched from the services layer, or directly from controllers/gateways. Commands are consumed by **Command Handlers**.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.service)
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameService {
  constructor(private commandBus: CommandBus) {}

  async killDragon(heroId: string, killDragonDto: KillDragonDto) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(
      new KillDragonCommand(heroId, killDragonDto.dragonId)
    );
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(CommandBus)
export class HeroesGameService {
  constructor(commandBus) {
    this.commandBus = commandBus;
  }

  async killDragon(heroId, killDragonDto) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(
      new KillDragonCommand(heroId, killDragonDto.dragonId)
    );
  }
}
```

Here's a sample service that dispatches `KillDragonCommand`. Let's see how the command looks:

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.command)
export class KillDragonCommand {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
export class KillDragonCommand {
  constructor(heroId, dragonId) {
    this.heroId = heroId;
    this.dragonId = dragonId;
  }
}
```

The `CommandBus` is a **stream** of commands. It delegates commands to the equivalent handlers. Each command must have a corresponding **Command Handler**:

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.handler)
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
export class KillDragonHandler implements ICommandHandler<KillDragonCommand> {
  constructor(private repository: HeroRepository) {}

  async execute(command: KillDragonCommand) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.repository.findOneById(+heroId);

    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    await this.repository.persist(hero);
  }
}
@@switch
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
@Dependencies(HeroRepository)
export class KillDragonHandler {
  constructor(repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  async execute(command) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.repository.findOneById(+heroId);

    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    await this.repository.persist(hero);
  }
}
```

With this approach, every application state change is driven by the occurrence of a **Command**. The logic is encapsulated in handlers. With this approach, we can simply add behavior like logging or persisting commands in the database (e.g., for diagnostics purposes).

#### Events

Command handlers neatly encapsulate logic. While beneficial, the application structure is still not flexible enough, not **reactive**. To remedy this, we also introduce **events**.

```typescript
@@filename(hero-killed-dragon.event)
export class HeroKilledDragonEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
export class HeroKilledDragonEvent {
  constructor(heroId, dragonId) {
    this.heroId = heroId;
    this.dragonId = dragonId;
  }
}
```

Events are asynchronous. They are dispatched either by **models** or directly using `EventBus`. In order to dispatch events, models have to extend the `AggregateRoot` class.

```typescript
@@filename(hero.model)
export class Hero extends AggregateRoot {
  constructor(private id: string) {
    super();
  }

  killEnemy(enemyId: string) {
    // logic
    this.apply(new HeroKilledDragonEvent(this.id, enemyId));
  }
}
@@switch
export class Hero extends AggregateRoot {
  constructor(id) {
    super();
    this.id = id;
  }

  killEnemy(enemyId) {
    // logic
    this.apply(new HeroKilledDragonEvent(this.id, enemyId));
  }
}
```

The `apply()` method does not dispatch events yet because there's no relationship between the model and the `EventPublisher` class. How do we associate the model and the publisher? By using a publisher `mergeObjectContext()` method inside our command handler.

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.handler)
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
export class KillDragonHandler implements ICommandHandler<KillDragonCommand> {
  constructor(
    private repository: HeroRepository,
    private publisher: EventPublisher,
  ) {}

  async execute(command: KillDragonCommand) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.publisher.mergeObjectContext(
      await this.repository.findOneById(+heroId),
    );
    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    hero.commit();
  }
}
@@switch
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
@Dependencies(HeroRepository, EventPublisher)
export class KillDragonHandler {
  constructor(repository, publisher) {
    this.repository = repository;
    this.publisher = publisher;
  }

  async execute(command) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.publisher.mergeObjectContext(
      await this.repository.findOneById(+heroId),
    );
    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    hero.commit();
  }
}
```

Now everything works as expected. Notice that we need to `commit()` events since they're not being dispatched immediately. Obviously, an object doesn't have to exist up front. We can easily merge type context as well:

```typescript
const HeroModel = this.publisher.mergeClassContext(Hero);
new HeroModel('id');
```

Now the model has the ability to publish events. Additionally, we can emit events manually using `EventBus`:

```typescript
this.eventBus.publish(new HeroKilledDragonEvent());
```

> info **Hint** The `EventBus` is an injectable class.

Each event can have multiple **Event Handlers**.

```typescript
@@filename(hero-killed-dragon.handler)
@EventsHandler(HeroKilledDragonEvent)
export class HeroKilledDragonHandler implements IEventHandler<HeroKilledDragonEvent> {
  constructor(private repository: HeroRepository) {}

  handle(event: HeroKilledDragonEvent) {
    // logic
  }
}
```

Now we can move the **write logic** into the event handlers.

#### Sagas

This type of **Event-Driven Architecture** improves application **reactiveness and scalability**. Now, when we have events, we can simply react to them in various ways. **Sagas** are the final building block from an architectural point of view.

Sagas are an extremely powerful feature. A single saga may listen for 1..\* events. Using the [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) library, it can combine, merge, filter or apply other `RxJS` operators on the event stream. Each saga returns an Observable which contains a command. This command is dispatched **asynchronously**.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.saga)
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameSagas {
  @Saga()
  dragonKilled = (events$: Observable<any>): Observable<ICommand> => {
    return events$.pipe(
      ofType(HeroKilledDragonEvent),
      map((event) => new DropAncientItemCommand(event.heroId, fakeItemID)),
    );
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameSagas {
  @Saga()
  dragonKilled = (events$) => {
    return events$.pipe(
      ofType(HeroKilledDragonEvent),
      map((event) => new DropAncientItemCommand(event.heroId, fakeItemID)),
    );
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ofType` operator is exported from the `@nestjs/cqrs` package.

We declared a rule - when any hero kills the dragon, the ancient item should be dropped. With this in place, `DropAncientItemCommand` will be dispatched and processed by the appropriate handler.

#### Queries

The `CqrsModule` can also be used for handling queries. The `QueryBus` follows the same pattern as the `CommandsBus`. Query handlers should implement the `IQueryHandler` interface and be marked with the `@QueryHandler()` decorator.

#### Setup

Finally, let's look at how to set up the whole CQRS mechanism.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.module)
export const CommandHandlers = [KillDragonHandler, DropAncientItemHandler];
export const EventHandlers =  [HeroKilledDragonHandler, HeroFoundItemHandler];

@Module({
  imports: [CqrsModule],
  controllers: [HeroesGameController],
  providers: [
    HeroesGameService,
    HeroesGameSagas,
    ...CommandHandlers,
    ...EventHandlers,
    HeroRepository,
  ]
})
export class HeroesGameModule {}
```

#### Summary

`CommandBus`, `QueryBus` and `EventBus` are **Observables**. This means that you can easily subscribe to the whole stream and enrich your application with **Event Sourcing**.

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest-cqrs-example).
