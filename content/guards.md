### Guards

A guard is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. Guards should implement the `CanActivate` interface.

Guards have a **single responsibility**. They determine whether a request shall be handled by the route handler or not. Until now, the access restriction logic was mostly inside the [middleware](/middleware). It's still fine since things such as token validation or attaching properties to the `request` object are not strongly connected with a particular routes (and their metadata).

But middleware, by its nature, is dumb. It doesn't know which handler will be executed after calling the `next()` function. On the other hand, **Guards** have an access to the `ExecutionContext` instance, and thus we know exactly what's going to be evaluated.

> info **Hint** Guards are executed **after** each middleware, but **before** any interceptor and pipe.

#### Authorization guard

One of the best guards use-cases is the **authorization** logic because specific routes should be available only when the caller has sufficient permissions. The `AuthGuard` that we have a plan to create is going to sequentially extract and validate the token sent in request headers.

```typescript
@@filename(auth.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return validateRequest(request);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard {
  async canActivate(context) {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return await validateRequest(request);
  }
}
```

Regardless of the logic that sits behind `validateRequest()` function, the main point is to show how simple is to take advantage of guards. Every guard provides a `canActivate()` function. The guard might return its boolean answer either synchronously or asynchronously via a (`Promise` or `Observable`). The returned value controls the Nest behavior:

- if it returns `true`, the user call will be processed.
- if it returns `false`, Nest will ignore a currently processed request.

The `canActivate()` function takes single argument, the `ExecutionContext` instance. The `ExecutionContext` inherits from `ArgumentsHost`. The `ArgumentsHost` is a wrapper around arguments that have been passed to the **original** handler, and it contains different arguments array under the hood based on the type of the application. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#arguments-host) (in the exception filters chapter).

#### Execution context

The `ExecutionContext` offers a little bit more. It extends `ArgumentsHost`, but also, provides more details about current execution process.

```typescript
export interface ExecutionContext extends ArgumentsHost {
  getClass<T = any>(): Type<T>;
  getHandler(): Function;
}
```

The `getHandler()` returns a reference to the currently processed handler, while `getClass()` returns a type of the `Controller` class which this particular handler belongs to. Using other words, if the user points to `create()` method that is defined and registered within `CatsController`, the `getHandler()` will return a reference to the `create()` method and `getClass()` in this case, will simply return a `CatsController` **type** (not instance).

#### Role-based authentication

A little bit more detailed example is a `RolesGuard`. This guard permits access only to users with a specific role. We are gonna start with a basic guard template:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    return true;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard {
  canActivate(context) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Binding guards

The guards can be **controller-scoped**, method-scoped, and global-scoped as well. In order to set up the guard, we have to use a `@UseGuards()` decorator. This decorator may take an endless number of arguments, meaning, you can pass several guards and separate them by a comma.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Controller('cats')
@UseGuards(RolesGuard)
export class CatsController {}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseGuards()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

We have passed the `RolesGuard` type instead of an instance, leaving framework the instantiation responsibility and enabling dependency injection. Another available way is to pass the immediately created instance:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Controller('cats')
@UseGuards(new RolesGuard())
export class CatsController {}
```

The construction above attaches the guard to every handler declared by this controller. If we decide to restrict only one of them, we just need to set up the guard at **method level**. In order to bind the global guard, we use the `useGlobalGuards()` method of the Nest application instance:

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
app.useGlobalGuards(new RolesGuard());
```

> warning **Notice** The `useGlobalGuards()` method doesn't set up guards for gateways and microservices (whereas hybrid app is being used).

The global guards are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of the dependency injection, global guards registered from the outside of any module (as in the previous example above) cannot inject dependencies since they don't belong to any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up a guard **directly from any module** using following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_GUARD } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_GUARD,
      useClass: RolesGuard,
    },
  ],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

> info **Hint** The alternative option is to use an [application context](/application-context) feature. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom providers registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/dependency-injection).

#### Reflection

The guard is working now, but we're still not taking advantage of the most important guard features, being the **execution context** .

The `RolesGuard` isn't reusable so far. How would we know which roles need to be processed by the handler? The `CatsController` could have a lot of them. Some might be available only for admin, some for everyone, although, they don't have any permissions.

That's why along with the guards, Nest provides the ability to attach custom **metadata** through `@SetMetadata()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@SetMetadata()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

With the construction above, we attached the `roles` metadata (`roles` is a key, while `['admin']` is a particular value) to the `create()` method. It's not a good practice to use `@SetMetadata()` directly. Instead, you should always create your own decorators:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.decorator)
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
@@switch
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
```

This approach is much cleaner and readable (and is strongly typed). Since we have the `@Roles()` decorator now, we can use it with the `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

Alright. Let's take a step back to the `RolesGuard` again. It simply returns `true` immediately, allowing request to proceed so far. In order to reflect the metadata, we'll use the `Reflector` helper class which is provided out of the box by the framework and exposed from the `@nestjs/core` package.

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private readonly reflector: Reflector) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
    if (!roles) {
      return true;
    }
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    const hasRole = () => user.roles.some((role) => roles.includes(role));
    return user && user.roles && hasRole();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(Reflector)
export class RolesGuard {
  constructor(reflector) {
    this.reflector = reflector;
  }

  canActivate(context) {
    const roles = this.reflector.get('roles', context.getHandler());
    if (!roles) {
      return true;
    }
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    const hasRole = () => user.roles.some((role) => roles.includes(role));
    return user && user.roles && hasRole();
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** In the node.js world, it's a common practice to attach the authorized user to the `request` object. That's why we assumed that `request.user` contains the user instance.

The `Reflector` allows us to easily reflect the metadata by the specified **key**. In the example above, we used `getHandler()` in order to reflect the metadata because it's a **reference** to the route handler function. We could make this guard even more generic if we add the controller reflection part as well. To extract the **controller metadata**, we should use `context.getClass()` instead of `getHandler()` function:

```typescript
@@filename()
const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getClass());
@@switch
const roles = this.reflector.get('roles', context.getClass());
```

When a user tries to call the `/cats` POST endpoint without enough privileges, Nest will automatically return response below:

```typescript
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden resource"
}
```

In fact, the guard which returns `false` throws `ForbiddenException`. If you want to return a different error response to the end-user, you should throw an exception.

```typescript
throw new UnauthorizedException();
```

Afterward, this exception can be caught by the [exception filter](/exception-filters) .
